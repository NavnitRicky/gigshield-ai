Executive Summary

GigShield is an AI-enabled parametric insurance platform that protects India's food delivery partners (Zomato, Swiggy, Zepto) against income loss caused by external disruptions — extreme weather, severe pollution, floods, unplanned curfews, and local strikes.

Unlike traditional insurance that requires claim filing and manual verification, GigShield uses parametric triggers — when weather data crosses predefined thresholds (e.g., temperature > 42°C, rainfall > 65mm/hr), claims are automatically initiated and payouts are processed instantly via UPI.

Key Differentiators

Zero-touch claims: No paperwork, no waiting — automated from trigger to payout
Weekly pricing: ₹29–79/week aligned with gig worker payout cycles
AI risk scoring: Dynamic premiums based on city, zone, vehicle type, working hours, and historical disruption patterns
Intelligent fraud detection: Multi-factor anomaly scoring using GPS validation, claim frequency analysis, and weather data cross-referencing
Hyper-local coverage: Zone-level parametric triggers, not just city-wide
Chosen Persona & Rationale

Persona: Food Delivery Partners (Zomato / Swiggy / Zepto)

Why food delivery?

Largest gig segment: Zomato and Swiggy alone engage 15+ lakh delivery partners monthly (Moneycontrol, Jan 2026)
Maximum weather exposure: Food delivery has the highest sensitivity to weather — riders spend 8-11 hours outdoors daily, directly exposed to heat, rain, and pollution
Predictable earnings structure: Base pay (₹20-50/order) + distance bonus (₹8-10/km beyond 5km) + incentives makes income loss quantifiable
Tight weekly cycles: Platforms pay weekly, making weekly premium billing natural
Growing but unprotected: India's gig workforce is projected to reach 23.5 million by 2030 (NITI Aayog), yet has zero income protection against climate disruptions
Delivery Partner Profile

Attribute	Typical Value
Daily earnings (gross)	₹800 - ₹1,500
Weekly earnings (full-time)	₹4,000 - ₹6,000
Monthly earnings (net, after fuel)	₹15,000 - ₹21,000
Daily working hours	8-11 hours
Earnings per hour	~₹102 (Zomato avg, 2025)
Vehicle type	Bike (70%), EV (15%), Bicycle (15%)
Income loss during heatwaves	Up to 40%
Income loss per °C rise	~19%

Problem Deep-Dive

The Income Loss Crisis

India's food delivery partners face a cruel paradox: the days they need income most (extreme weather = people ordering in) are often the days they physically cannot work.

Research findings:

Workers experience a 19% decrease in net earnings for every 1°C increase in wet-bulb temperature (EfD Initiative)
During heatwaves, earnings drop by up to 40% (EfD study of 400 workers in Delhi, 2019)
Delhi summer 2024 recorded temperatures exceeding 49°C — delivery platforms saw significant rider shortages
Gig workers in Hyderabad spend 6-8 hours outdoors in 45-50°C conditions without access to shade or healthcare (Down To Earth)
Heat-related medical expenses increase 14% per degree of temperature rise, reaching 25% on heatwave days
Why Current Solutions Fail

Current State	Problem
No insurance exists	Gig workers bear 100% of income loss risk
Traditional insurance	Requires claim filing, documentation, weeks of processing
Platform pause compensation	Minimal or non-existent — "If I don't log in, I don't earn"
Government schemes	Not designed for app-based gig economy
GigShield fills this gap with automated, parametric coverage specifically designed for the gig earnings cycle.

Solution Overview

How GigShield Works

[Disruption Occurs] → [Parametric Trigger Detected] → [AI Validates] → [Auto-Claim Created] → [Fraud Check] → [Instant Payout via UPI]
     (Weather API)      (Threshold exceeded)          (Risk score)     (Zero-touch)           (Score < 30)     (< 60 seconds)
Core Flow

Onboarding: Worker registers with platform, city, zone, vehicle type, and earnings data
Risk Profiling: AI calculates a risk score (0-100) based on location risk, vehicle type, working hours, and experience
Policy Selection: Choose Basic (₹29/wk), Standard (₹49/wk), or Premium (₹79/wk) coverage
Dynamic Premium: AI adjusts the exact premium using the worker's personal risk score
Monitoring: Real-time weather/disruption data is continuously checked against parametric thresholds
Auto-Claim: When thresholds are breached, claims are automatically generated for affected workers
Fraud Detection: AI scores each claim for anomalies (0-100). Low-risk claims are auto-approved
Instant Payout: Approved claims trigger immediate UPI transfer of lost income compensation
Persona-Based Scenarios & Workflow

Scenario 1: Heatwave in Delhi (Rajesh, Zomato Rider)

Profile: Rajesh Kumar, bike rider, South Delhi zone, 10h/day, ₹4,500/week
Event: Delhi hits 47°C (threshold: 42°C) — IMD issues extreme heat warning

Flow:

OpenWeatherMap API reports 47°C for South Delhi → Parametric trigger fires
GigShield creates a weather alert: "Extreme Heat — Delhi — Extreme severity"
System identifies Rajesh as covered (Standard plan, covers extreme_heat)
Auto-claim generated: 10h of lost income (extreme severity) = ₹750 payout
AI fraud check runs → Score: 5/100 (low risk) → Auto-approved
₹750 sent to Rajesh's UPI within 60 seconds
Rajesh receives SMS: "GigShield payout: ₹750 for extreme heat disruption"
Scenario 2: Mumbai Monsoon Flooding (Amit, Swiggy Rider)

Profile: Amit Sharma, bike rider, Andheri zone, 11h/day, ₹5,200/week
Event: Heavy rainfall (95mm/hr) causes waterlogging in Andheri

Flow:

Weather API detects 95mm/hr rainfall (threshold: 65mm/hr) → Severe rain trigger
All Andheri-zone Swiggy riders with rain coverage are identified
Auto-claim: 6h lost (severe) = ₹567 payout calculated from Amit's hourly rate
Fraud score: 8/100 → Auto-approved
Instant UPI payout
Scenario 3: Fraudulent Claim Detection (Kavita, Swiggy Rider)

Profile: Kavita Devi, Hyderabad, 10h/day, ₹4,100/week
Event: Kavita's account shows a heat-related claim, but GPS data shows she was in a covered area, and she already filed 3 claims this week

Flow:

Claim submitted for extreme heat at 44°C
AI fraud detection runs:
High frequency flag (3 claims in 7 days): +30 points
Duplicate time window (claim within 1 hour of previous): +25 points
Total fraud score: 72/100 → Claim flagged for manual review
Admin reviews and either approves or rejects
Kavita is notified of the decision
Weekly Premium Model

Pricing Structure

Plan	Weekly Premium	Max Weekly Coverage	Disruptions Covered
Basic	~₹29/week	₹1,500	Extreme Heat, Heavy Rain
Standard	~₹49/week	₹3,000	+ Flood, Pollution
Premium	~₹79/week	₹5,000	+ Curfew, Strike
Dynamic Premium Formula

Weekly Premium = Base Rate × Avg Weekly Earnings × Risk Multiplier

Where:
- Base Rate = { Basic: 1.5%, Standard: 2.5%, Premium: 4.0% }
- Risk Multiplier = 0.7 + (Risk Score / 100) × 0.6
  (ranges from 0.7x for safest to 1.3x for riskiest workers)
Risk Score Calculation (AI-Powered)

The risk score (0-100) is computed from multiple factors:

Factor	Impact	Rationale
City risk (Delhi/Mumbai/Chennai)	+3 to +15	Historical disruption frequency
Vehicle type (bicycle > bike > EV)	+2 to +15	Vulnerability to weather
Daily working hours (>10h)	+5 to +10	More outdoor exposure
Experience (<6 months)	+6 to +12	Less route optimization skill
Experience (>24 months)	-8	Better risk management
Example: Delhi bike rider, 10h/day, 6 months experience
→ Base(50) + Delhi(15) + Bike(5) + Hours(5) + NewRider(6) = Risk Score: 81
→ Standard Plan Premium: ₹4,500 × 2.5% × 1.186 = ₹133/week

vs.

Pune EV rider, 8h/day, 36 months experience
→ Base(50) + Pune(3) + EV(2) + Hours(0) + Experienced(-8) = Risk Score: 47
→ Standard Plan Premium: ₹4,300 × 2.5% × 0.982 = ₹106/week

Why Weekly?

Gig workers earn and think in weekly cycles
Zomato/Swiggy pay riders weekly
Weekly billing reduces commitment anxiety (vs. monthly/annual)
Allows dynamic repricing each week as conditions change
Workers can opt in/out based on seasonal risk (e.g., subscribe during monsoon/summer)
Parametric Triggers

Trigger Thresholds

Disruption	Trigger Threshold	Data Source	Severity Levels
Extreme Heat	> 42°C	OpenWeatherMap / IMD	Warning (42-44°C), Severe (44-46°C), Extreme (>46°C)
Heavy Rain	> 65 mm/hr	OpenWeatherMap	Warning (65-80), Severe (80-100), Extreme (>100)
Flood	Water level > 1.5m	Mock / Municipal APIs	Warning (1.5-2m), Severe (2-3m), Extreme (>3m)
Air Pollution	AQI > 300	CPCB / OpenWeatherMap Air	Warning (300-400), Severe (400-500), Extreme (>500)
Curfew	Section 144 declared	News API / Mock	Binary trigger
Strike	Zone closure reported	News API / Mock	Binary trigger
Income Loss Calculation

Payout = min(Hours Lost × Hourly Rate, Max Weekly Coverage)

Where:
- Hours Lost = { Warning: 3h, Severe: 6h, Extreme: 10h }
- Hourly Rate = Worker's Avg Weekly Earnings / (Avg Daily Hours × 6 working days)
Why Parametric (Not Indemnity)?

Parametric	Traditional Indemnity
Payout based on trigger event	Payout based on actual loss proof
Automatic, zero paperwork	Manual claim filing required
< 60 seconds processing	Weeks to months
Objective threshold (42°C)	Subjective assessment
Perfect for gig workers	Designed for formal employment
Low operational cost	High administrative overhead
AI/ML Integration Plan

Phase 1 (Current): Rule-Based AI

Risk scoring: Multi-factor scoring algorithm using city, vehicle, hours, experience
Premium calculation: Dynamic pricing formula with risk multiplier
Fraud detection: Rule-based anomaly scoring (frequency, duplicates, GPS, timing)
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Machine Learning Models

Model	Purpose	Training Data
Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost)	Premium pricing optimization	Historical claims, weather, earnings data
Isolation Forest	Fraud anomaly detection	Claim patterns, GPS trajectories
Time-Series LSTM	Predictive weather risk for next week	5-year historical weather data per city
Random Forest	Claim approval confidence scoring	Labeled claims dataset
Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Advanced AI

GPS trajectory validation: Compare claimed work area vs. actual GPS data during disruption hours
Predictive analytics: ML model predicts next week's disruption probability → dynamic premium adjustment
Cross-referencing engine: Match weather data × platform login data × GPS data to validate claims
Historical pattern detection: Flag workers whose claims don't correlate with zone-level weather data
Fraud Detection Architecture

Multi-Layer Detection

Layer 1: Parametric Validation
  └── Does weather data actually confirm the disruption? (Cross-ref with OpenWeatherMap)

Layer 2: Behavioral Analysis
  ├── Claim frequency (>3/week = suspicious)
  ├── Duplicate time windows (<1hr between claims)
  └── Excessive hours claimed (>10h)

Layer 3: Location Validation (Phase 2)
  ├── GPS vs. claimed zone match
  ├── Platform login activity correlation
  └── Neighboring worker claim patterns

Layer 4: Pattern Recognition (Phase 3)
  ├── Isolation Forest anomaly detection
  ├── Historical claim ratio vs. zone average
  └── Cross-worker collusion detection
Fraud Score Thresholds

Score	Action	Rationale
0-29	Auto-approve	Low risk, verified parametric event
30-59	Queue for review	Moderate anomalies detected
60-100	Flag + hold	High fraud indicators, manual review required

 Platform Choice Justification

Why Web (Not Mobile)?

Factor	Web	Mobile
Development speed	Faster for hackathon timeline	Slower (native for both iOS/Android)
Accessibility	Works on any device with a browser	Requires app download
Deployment	Instant updates, no app store review	Play Store review delays
Admin dashboard	Natural fit for desktop web	Poor fit for mobile
Worker access	Mobile-responsive web works well	Better native UX
Decision: Build a responsive web app that works well on both desktop (admin) and mobile (worker).
Phase 2 consideration: If needed, wrap in a PWA or React Native for app-like mobile experience.
